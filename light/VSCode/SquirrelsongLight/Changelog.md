- Better code readability: fewer bright colors (red, orange) but more color variation (fewer long pieces of code of the same color), introduction of bold and italic.
- Lots of customizations for different languages to improve readability and to make highlighting more consistent between different languages (for example, “this” in TypeScript is styled the same way as “$this” in PHP and “self” in Python or Rust, variables are styled the same in all languages, and HTML is styled the same way as JSX).
