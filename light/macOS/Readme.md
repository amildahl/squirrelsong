# Squirrelsong Light Theme for macOS

> [!WARNING]
> The actual color never goes brighter than `#e3e3e3` instead of `#f7f6f9`, and this color is the closest I could get to the theme colors.

## Installation

1. Turn on reduced transparency to see any color on the menu bar: **Apple menu** → **System Settings** → **Accessibility** → **Display** → **Reduce transparency**.
2. Accent/selection colors
3. Mouse cursor colors
